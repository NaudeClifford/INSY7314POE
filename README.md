# HustleHub+: Secure MERN Freelance Marketplace

**INSY7314 POE, Part 3: Secure Stack** · Group 1

HustleHub+ is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) marketplace. **Freelancers** list services ("gigs"), **clients** browse and book them, and **admins** oversee the platform. Part 2 extended the Part 1 HTTPS and authentication backend into a secured application. Part 3 adds an income and tax dashboard, CI checks, and SonarQube Cloud analysis in a companion repository. The application includes:

- a marketplace API (gigs, bookings, transactions and income)
- role-based access control (RBAC)
- input validation and sanitisation
- rate limiting
- security headers with a Content Security Policy
- a React frontend
- automated backend and frontend tests
- tax-year income summaries and an indicative SARS-based tax estimate
- GitHub Actions checks for tests, builds, API integration, and static analysis

> The Part 1 architecture report, diagram and screenshots are kept in [`docs/Part1-Report.md`](docs/Part1-Report.md).

## 5. Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS or newer
- MongoDB running locally (`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`) **or** a MongoDB Atlas connection string
- OpenSSL, used once to generate the local HTTPS certificate. Git for Windows includes it.
- Postman (optional, because Newman runs the same collection from the terminal)

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
cd Project
npm install
npm install --prefix server
npm install --prefix client
```

### Step 2: Environment variables

**Backend:** create `server/.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

**Project Root:** create `Project/.env` (copy `Project/.env.example`):
```emv
MONGO_URI="local host using mongoDB compass or cloud using mongoDB atlas"

//When deploying, set NODE_ENV to production
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_DB_DEV=test
MONGO_DB_PROD=INSY7314HustleHub+
MONGO_DB_NAME="INSY7314HustleHub+"

JWT_SECRET=node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://localhost:5173

SSL_KEY_PATH=server\certificates\localhost-key.pem
SSL_CERT_PATH=server\certificates\localhost-cert.pem
```
Important Note, for development: NODE_ENV=development
For Production: NODE_ENV=production
This switches DBs from testing seeded data to production data and prevents accidental mix of data.

> `MONGO_DB_NAME` must contain `dev`, `local` or `test`. The seed script refuses to run on any other name, so it can never wipe a production database.
> Generate a strong secret with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"`.

**Frontend:** create `Project/client/.env` (copy `Project/client/.env.example`):

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:5000
VITE_APP_NAME=HustleHub+
```

`.env` files and certificates are git-ignored and must never be committed.

### Step 3: Certificate and seed data

```bash
npm run generate-cert
npm run seed
```

Seeded accounts (password `Password123!`):

| Role | Email |
| --- | --- |
| Client | `client@hustlehub.test` |
| Freelancer | `john@hustlehub.test`, `sarah@hustlehub.test` |
| Admin | `admin@hustlehub.test` |

### Step 4: Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

| App | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Backend API | <https://localhost:5000> |
| Frontend | <https://localhost:5173> |

Both use a self-signed certificate. Open <https://localhost:5000> once and accept the browser warning, otherwise the frontend cannot reach the API. Then open <https://localhost:5173>.

To run them separately: `npm run server` and `npm run client`.

---

## 6. Backend API

The Express API is the core of the application: every business rule and every security check runs on the server.

### 6.1 Data model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ GIG : "creates (freelancer)"
    USER ||--o{ BOOKING : "books (client)"
    GIG ||--o{ BOOKING : "is booked in"
    BOOKING ||--|| TRANSACTION : "creates"
    USER ||--o{ TRANSACTION : "pays / earns"
```

| Collection | Key fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | name, email (unique, lowercase), password (bcrypt hash), role (`Client` / `Freelancer` / `Admin`), isActive, bio, skills, phone, location | Deactivated users cannot log in or use existing tokens |
| `gigs` | freelancerId → User, title, description, category, price, deliveryDays, location.address, status (`active` / `paused` / `deleted`), views | Delete is a soft delete, so booking history stays intact |
| `bookings` | gigId, clientId, freelancerId, agreedPrice, bookingDate, status, completedAt | `agreedPrice` is copied from the gig at booking time |
| `transactions` | bookingId (unique), clientId, freelancerId, amount, platformFee, taxAmount, freelancerAmount, status, invoiceNumber, payoutDate | Exactly one per booking |
| `apiusages` | date, endpoint, method, statusCode, successful | Written by middleware on every request |
| `reviews`, `analytics` | Not used in Part 2 | Supporting collections |

Indexes are created by the `migrate-mongo` migrations in `Project/migrations/`.

### 6.2 Booking and simulated payment

When a client books a gig (`POST /api/bookings`):

1. The server loads the gig. It must be `active`, and a freelancer cannot book their own gig.
2. A **booking** is created. The client is the logged-in user, and the price is copied **from the database**. Any price in the request body is ignored.
3. A **transaction** is created and linked to the booking, the client and the freelancer:

| Field | Calculation | Example (R1 000 gig) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `amount` | gig price | R1 000.00 |
| `platformFee` | 10% of amount | R100.00 |
| `taxAmount` | R0.00 for new transactions; the annual estimate is calculated separately | R0.00 |
| `freelancerAmount` | amount - fee | R900.00 |
| `invoiceNumber` | `INV-<bookingId>` | `INV-6650…` |

If the transaction cannot be saved, the booking is rolled back, so a booking never exists without its transaction.

### 6.3 Booking lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending: client books
    pending --> accepted: freelancer
    pending --> cancelled: client or freelancer
    accepted --> in_progress: freelancer
    accepted --> cancelled: client or freelancer
    in_progress --> completed: freelancer
    completed --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]
```

- Completing a booking sets the transaction to `completed`; cancelling sets it to `refunded`.
- Any other jump (for example `pending → completed`) is rejected with `400`.
- Admins can record a **payout** on a completed transaction (`PATCH /api/transactions/:id/payout`). It can only be done once.

### 6.4 Income tracking

`GET /api/income` returns the logged-in freelancer's current South African tax-year totals from completed transactions and bookings. It groups each payment by the booking's completion date:

- **period:** tax year and its 1 March to 28 February bounds
- **summary:** gross earnings, platform fees, taxable platform income, estimated annual tax, income after estimated tax, and any historical recorded tax deductions
- **monthlyIncome:** twelve months of earnings after fees and before estimated tax
- **taxMethod:** the rate year, primary rebate, SARS source, and calculation assumptions

### 6.5 Admin and monitoring

- **Dashboard:** user counts by role, active gigs, bookings, completed bookings, platform revenue (fees from completed bookings) and total API requests.
- **Management:** users (role and active status; an admin cannot remove their own Admin role), gigs (pause or remove) and bookings (status).
- **API usage:** every request is logged with its endpoint, method and status code, then grouped by day and endpoint into success and failure counts.

## 7. Role-based access control (RBAC)

RBAC is enforced **on the server**. The React route guards only improve the user experience. Hiding a link is not security.

### 7.1 How a request is authorised

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R[Request] --> P{protect<br/>valid JWT cookie?<br/>user active?}
    P -- no --> U[401 Unauthorized]
    P -- yes --> A{authorizeRoles<br/>role allowed?}
    A -- no --> F[403 Forbidden]
    A -- yes --> O{Controller<br/>owns the record?}
    O -- no --> N[403 / 404]
    O -- yes --> OK[200 / 201]
```

```js
// middleware/authMiddleware.js
const authorizeRoles = (...allowedRoles) => (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.user || !allowedRoles.includes(req.user.role)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: "You do not have permission to perform this action." });
  }
  next();
};

// routes/gigRoutes.js
router.post("/", protect, authorizeRoles("Freelancer"), validateGig, createGig);
```

### 7.2 Role rules

| Rule | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Only **Freelancers** create, edit or delete gigs and see income | `gigRoutes.js`, `incomeRoutes.js` |
| Only **Clients** create bookings | `bookingRoutes.js` |
| Only **Admins** reach `/api/admin/*`, list or delete users, and record payouts | `adminRoutes.js`, `userRoutes.js`, `transactionRoutes.js` |
| Public registration accepts only `Client` or `Freelancer`, never `Admin` | `validateRegistration.js`, `authController.js` |
| An admin cannot remove their own Admin role | `adminController.js` |

### 7.3 Ownership: users cannot touch data that isn't theirs

| Resource | Check | Result for a non-owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gig update / delete / edit view | Query filter includes `freelancerId: req.user.id` | `404 Not found` (existence is not revealed) |
| Booking view | User must be the client, the freelancer or an admin | `403` |
| Booking status change | Only the owning freelancer; the owning client may only cancel | `403` |
| Transaction view | User must be the client, the freelancer or an admin | `403` |
| Lists (my gigs, bookings, transactions, income) | Always filtered by the logged-in user's ID | Only own records returned |

The owner and the price are **never taken from the request body**: `freelancerId`, `clientId` and all money values come from the token and the database, so they cannot be spoofed.

---

## 8. API security: JWT, validation and sanitisation

### 8.1 Authentication with JWT

- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** (10 salt rounds) and never returned by the API.
- After login the server signs a JWT that contains only the user ID and role, and expires after 1 hour (`JWT_EXPIRES_IN`).
- The token is stored in a cookie with these flags:

  | Flag | Protection |
  | --- | --- |
  | `HttpOnly` | JavaScript cannot read the token, so XSS cannot steal it |
  | `Secure` | Sent over HTTPS only |
  | `SameSite=Lax` | Not sent on cross-site POST requests (CSRF) |

  The frontend never stores tokens in `localStorage`.
- `protect` verifies the signature and expiry on every protected request, then reloads the user from the database. Deleted or deactivated accounts are rejected immediately, even while their token is still valid.
- Login failures always return `Invalid email or password.`, so attackers cannot find out which emails are registered.
- `server.js` refuses to start without `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`, and secrets live only in git-ignored `.env` files.

### 8.2 Input validation and sanitisation

| Input | Validation |
| --- | --- |
| Registration | `express-validator`: name 2 to 100 characters with no `<` or `>`; valid email (trimmed and normalised); password 8 to 128 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number and special character; role `Client` or `Freelancer` |
| Login | Email and password must be strings of a valid length; objects are rejected |
| Gig | Text fields must be strings of a limited length with no `<` or `>`; price a number from 0 to 10 000 000 with at most 2 decimals; delivery 1 to 365 days; image URL must start with `http(s)://`; status `active` or `paused` |
| Booking | `gigId` must be a valid ObjectId; date from today up to 1 year ahead |
| Profile | Name, phone, bio, skills and location are type- and length-checked, with no `<` or `>` |
| URL IDs | `validateId` rejects invalid ObjectIds before the database is queried |
| Search | Trimmed, limited to 80 characters and regex-escaped |
| Body size | JSON limited to 32 KB (`413` if larger); malformed JSON returns `400` |

**How this stops injection and scripting attacks:**

- **NoSQL injection:** operator objects such as `{"$gt": ""}` fail the type checks, so they never reach a MongoDB query.
- **XSS:** tags are rejected at input. React also escapes everything it renders, and no page uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. The CSP (section 9) is a further layer.
- **Information leakage:** validation errors return field names and messages but never the submitted values, so passwords are not echoed back.

### 8.3 CSRF and CORS

- **CORS** allows only `CLIENT_ORIGIN`, with credentials.
- Any `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` whose `Origin` header is not the trusted client is rejected with `403 Request origin is not allowed.` This adds to the protection from `SameSite=Lax` cookies.

### 8.4 Safe error handling

A central error handler returns controlled JSON for `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `413` and `500`. Stack traces, Mongoose errors, file paths and connection strings are never sent to the client, and unexpected errors are logged without credentials. Public gig listings populate only a freelancer's name, picture and rating, never their email or password.

---

## 9. Rate limiting and security headers

### 9.1 Rate limiting

`express-rate-limit` is configured in `app.js`:

| Endpoint | Limit (per IP) | Response when exceeded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/users` | 30 requests / 15 minutes | `429` `{"message":"Too many authentication attempts. Try again later."}` |
| `POST /api/bookings` | 20 bookings / hour | `429` `{"message":"Booking limit reached. Try again later."}` |

- The login limit slows brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks. The booking limit stops automated booking spam.
- Every response carries the standard `RateLimit` and `RateLimit-Policy` headers (IETF draft-7), so clients can see the limit and how many requests are left. Legacy `X-RateLimit-*` headers are turned off.
- The frontend shows the 429 message to the user (tested in `NewBooking.test.jsx`).

```js
const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  limit: 30,
  standardHeaders: "draft-7",
  legacyHeaders: false,
  message: { message: "Too many authentication attempts. Try again later." }
});
```

### 9.2 Security headers (Helmet)

Helmet runs before every route.

| Header | Protects against |
| --- | --- |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | XSS, injected scripts, clickjacking, data exfiltration |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | Downgrade to HTTP |
| `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` | MIME-type sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options` | Clickjacking |
| `Referrer-Policy` | Leaking URLs to other sites |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | Cross-origin attacks |
| `X-Powered-By` removed | Revealing that the server runs Express |

### 9.3 Content Security Policy

**API CSP** (`app.js`):

```text
default-src 'self'; base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';
script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https:;
connect-src 'self' https://localhost:5173
```

**Frontend CSP** (`vite.config.js`), sent by the Vite server:

| Directive | Preview / production | Development |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `script-src` | `'self'` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (React refresh preamble) |
| `style-src` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline'` | same |
| `connect-src` | `'self'` + API origin | + `wss://localhost:5173` (hot reload) |
| `object-src` / `frame-ancestors` / `base-uri` | `'none'` / `'none'` / `'self'` | same |

Scripts can load only from the app itself, plugins and framing are blocked, `<base>` tags cannot redirect links, and the page can only send data to its own API.

---

## 10. React frontend

The frontend is a React 19 single-page app built with Vite and React Router 7. It runs over HTTPS in development.

### 10.1 Pages

| Area | Route | Page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public | `/` | Home / landing page |
| | `/marketplace` | Browse gigs with search and category filter |
| | `/gigs/:id` | Gig details with a "Book" action |
| | `/login`, `/signup` | Authentication |
| Any logged-in user | `/profile` | View, edit or deactivate profile |
| | `/bookings` | Bookings list with status actions |
| Client and Freelancer | `/transactions` | Transaction history |
| Client | `/bookings/new?gigId=` | Booking confirmation (simulated payment) |
| Freelancer | `/dashboard` | Income summary, recent activity, quick actions |
| | `/my-gigs`, `/create-gig`, `/gigs/:id/edit` | Gig management (create, edit, pause, delete) |
| | `/income` | Income breakdown and monthly income |
| Admin | `/admin` | Dashboard |
| | `/admin/users`, `/admin/users/:id/edit` | User management |
| | `/admin/gigs`, `/admin/bookings` | Moderation |
| | `/admin/analytics`, `/admin/api-usage` | Reports |
| Any | `*` | Not found page |

### 10.2 Authentication and route protection

- **`AuthContext`** restores the session on load by calling `/api/auth/me` with `credentials: "include"`. The token itself stays in the HttpOnly cookie and never reaches JavaScript.
- **`ProtectedRoute`** shows a loading state while the session is restored, then sends logged-out users to `/login`.
- **`RoleRoute`** sends users away from pages for other roles.
- After login, users are redirected by role: Admin → `/admin`, Freelancer → `/dashboard`, Client → `/`.
- The **Navbar** only shows links for the current role and includes Logout.

### 10.3 Usability and safe input handling

- Every data page has **loading**, **empty** and **error** states (for example "No bookings yet").
- API error messages are shown as given (for example "Invalid email or password." or the 429 message). The UI never shows stack traces or tokens.
- Forms use HTML5 validation (`required`, `type="email"`, a minimum date) and client checks such as password confirmation and numeric price. The server still validates everything.
- Destructive actions (deleting a gig, deactivating a user) ask for confirmation first.
- Booking sends only `gigId` and the date. The price shown is for display only and is never trusted by the API.

## 11. Testing

| Suite | Tool | Location | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend unit/integration | `node --test` | `Project/server/test/` | Run by CI |
| API end-to-end | Postman + Newman | `PostmanCollection/` | 69 requests, 169 assertions |
| Rate-limit demo | Newman (35 iterations) | `PostmanCollection/` | `429` after 30 attempts |
| Frontend | Vitest + React Testing Library | `Project/client/src/__tests__/` | Run by CI |

Run every command from the `Project` folder.

### 11.1 Backend automated tests

```bash
npm run test:server
```

The API tests start the real Express app over HTTPS on a random port. Controller and model tests isolate database calls, so **MongoDB is not needed** for this suite.

- **`api.test.js`** (Part 1, updated for cookie auth) covers:
  - HTTPS and the certificate
  - registration validation, password hashing and duplicate handling
  - the login cookie (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, no token in the body)
  - malformed, expired and forged JWTs, and `403` for the wrong role
  - malformed and oversized JSON, and safe 500 errors
- **`marketplace-security.test.js`** (Part 2) covers:
  - Helmet and CSP headers, and the CSRF origin check
  - RBAC for gigs, bookings, admin and income
  - ownership of gigs and transactions
  - owner spoofing and price tampering
  - transaction fee and payout calculation; annual tax estimation has separate tests
  - XSS and NoSQL-injection rejection, and invalid IDs
  - both rate limiters returning `429`

### 11.2 Postman collection and Newman

**`HustleHub Part 2 - Secure Marketplace API`** registers fresh users on every run, then tests the full flow in folders:

| Folder | Success and failure cases |
| --- | --- |
| 0. Health & Security Headers | HTTPS; CSP, HSTS, nosniff and X-Frame-Options present; X-Powered-By hidden |
| 1. Registration & Login Validation | Valid registration; duplicate (409); weak password; XSS in name; Admin self-registration blocked; missing fields; generic login error; NoSQL injection; malformed JSON |
| 2. Freelancer - Gig Management | HttpOnly/Secure login cookie; create, update and list own gigs; bad gig data rejected; freelancer can't book or reach admin |
| 3. Client - Browse & Book | Public browsing hides private fields; regex search is escaped; client can't create, edit or delete gigs or see income; invalid bookings rejected; booking creates a transaction with server-side price and correct fees |
| 4. Freelancer - Bookings & Income | Invalid status jump rejected; accept → start → complete; transaction completed; income includes the net amount |
| 5. Ownership - Other Freelancer | A second freelancer can't edit, delete or view the first freelancer's gig, booking or transaction |
| 6. Admin | Dashboard, user list without password hashes, any transaction, all bookings |
| 7. Token & Session Security | Rejected after logout; forged JWT rejected; foreign Origin blocked; controlled 404 |

Run it with Newman (backend running, database seeded):

```bash
npm run dev          # terminal 1
npm run test:api     # terminal 2  → NewmanReports/newman-report.html
```

Run the rate-limit demo **last**, because it locks login for 15 minutes. Restart the server to reset it:

```bash
npm run test:ratelimit   # → NewmanReports/newman-ratelimit-report.html
```

**Newman HTML report:** 
The report is saved in the repository at [`NewmanReports/newman-report.html`](NewmanReports/newman-report.html).

> The main collection makes about 14 login and register calls, so it can run twice in 15 minutes before the login limit applies. Restart the backend to reset the in-memory counter.
>
> To use the Postman app instead: import the collection, turn **SSL certificate verification** off (the certificate is self-signed) and click *Run collection*. Postman handles the auth cookie automatically.

### 11.3 Frontend automated tests

```bash
npm run test:client
```

| Test file | Rendering | User interaction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Login.test.jsx` | Form, fields, button | Typing; wrong password shows a safe error; cookie sent; redirect by role |
| `Signup.test.jsx` | Fields; Admin not offered | Password mismatch blocked; API error shown; correct payload; redirect |
| `Marketplace.test.jsx` | Loading → gigs; `<script>` rendered as text | Search and category filters; empty state; API failure |
| `NewBooking.test.jsx` | Gig, price and location | Only `gigId` and date sent; redirect; 429 message shown |
| `RouteGuards.test.jsx` | Loading state | Logged-out → login; wrong role → home; right role sees the page |
| `Navbar.test.jsx` | Links per role | Logout calls `logout()` |

`fetch` is mocked, so these tests need neither the backend nor the database.

### 11.4 Run everything

```bash
npm run test:all     # backend + frontend automated tests
npm run test:api     # Newman (backend must be running)
```

## 16. Part 3 income, CI and static analysis

### Income and tax dashboard

The freelancer `/income` page uses completed bookings in the current South African tax year (1 March to 28 February). The API groups earnings by **booking completion date**, rather than booking creation date, and returns twelve monthly values plus gross earnings, platform fees, estimated taxable platform income, indicative tax and income after estimated tax. The dashboard shows the same figures and explains the calculation.

The estimate uses the [SARS 2027 individual tax brackets and primary rebate](https://www.sars.gov.za/tax-rates/income-tax/rates-of-tax-for-individuals/). It applies the progressive bracket to completed earnings less platform fees, subtracts the R17,820 primary rebate and floors the result at zero. For example, R120,000 completed earnings less R12,000 fees gives R108,000 taxable platform income; 18% is R19,440, less the rebate gives **R1,620 estimated tax**. It assumes an individual under 65 with no other income, expenses, deductions or tax credits. It is an estimate, not tax withheld or a final tax assessment. The fixed 2027 rates require review for future tax years.

New simulated transactions deduct the 10% platform fee and record zero tax withheld. Older transactions retain their recorded amounts; the income page shows any historical simulated tax deductions separately. The monthly chart shows earnings after platform fees and before estimated tax. The income cards and chart accommodate empty months, mobile screens and large currency values.

[Screenshot: Part 3 income and tax dashboard showing the tax-year heading, summary cards, twelve-month chart and calculation breakdown.]

### Repository used for SonarQube Cloud

This is the Classroom50 repository. The Classroom50 organization blocked SonarQube Cloud access to it, and it could not be forked. A separate [HustleHub Part 3 SonarQube test repository](https://github.com/st10437348/insy7314-final-poe-SonarQube-test) was therefore created as a copy of the application so the GitHub Actions scan could run. The copy has its own commit history; it is not a fork or a SonarQube scan of this Classroom50 repository. Application fixes from the test repository were brought back here. All SonarQube Cloud results described below came from the **test repository's** Cloud project, not this repository.

The Classroom50 workflow retains a conditional SonarQube job, but the organization restriction means it is skipped by default. Its required backend, frontend, API integration and final status checks still run. The test repository's workflow runs the SonarQube job as a required check and waits for the Cloud quality gate.

### GitHub Actions pipelines and workflows

#### `CI and static analysis` in this Classroom50 repository

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs for every push and pull request and can also be started manually. GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners use Node.js 22 and lockfile-based `npm ci` installs. Its jobs run independently unless a dependency is stated:

| Job | Work performed | What makes it fail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backend` | Installs `Project/server` dependencies, checks high or critical **runtime** dependency advisories, runs the Node.js backend test suite, and parses every backend JavaScript file with `node --check`. | A dependency audit, test or syntax check fails. |
| `frontend` | Installs `Project/client` dependencies, checks high or critical runtime advisories, runs ESLint and Vitest, then builds the production React bundle with Vite. | An audit, lint rule, test or build fails. |
| `api-integration` | Starts a health-checked MongoDB 7 service, generates a temporary JWT secret, installs the root and backend packages, audits root runtime dependencies, creates the test HTTPS certificate, seeds only the `hustlehub_ci` database, starts the HTTPS API, waits for its health endpoint, and runs the Postman collection through Newman. | Installation, audit, database seed, API startup, health check or a Newman assertion fails. |
| `sonarqube` | When enabled, waits for `backend` and `frontend`, generates backend and frontend LCOV reports, checks for the Cloud credentials, runs `SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@v8.3.0`, and waits for the quality gate. | Required configuration is missing, analysis fails, or the Cloud quality gate fails. It is **skipped by default here** because the organization blocks the connection. |
| `ci-result` | Runs even when an earlier job fails. It requires `backend`, `frontend` and `api-integration` to succeed. It requires `sonarqube` to have been skipped when disabled, or to succeed when enabled. | Any required result differs from the expected status. |

`api-integration` uploads the Newman HTML report as a `newman-report` artifact even when the test job fails; on failure it also uploads the API log. The MongoDB service and generated secret exist only for that CI run. The workflow does not deploy the application.

[Screenshot: Classroom50 GitHub Actions “CI and static analysis” run showing the backend, frontend, API integration, SonarQube skip and final `ci-result` statuses.]


#### `CI and static analysis` in the SonarQube test repository

The [test repository](https://github.com/st10437348/insy7314-final-poe-SonarQube-test) has the same backend, frontend and Newman integration checks. Its `sonarqube` job is **required** rather than conditional. It starts only after backend and frontend checks succeed, installs both packages, creates their LCOV coverage reports, and scans the source with the official SonarQube action. The action waits for the SonarQube Cloud quality gate, so a completed scan with a failed gate fails the job. Its final `ci-result` requires all four jobs to succeed; a skipped or failed SonarQube job cannot produce a green result. The test repository did not retain CodeQL as a second scanner because GitHub code scanning was unavailable there; SonarQube Cloud supplied the static analysis and quality gate.

The [Sonar project configuration](sonar-project.properties) scans `Project/server` and `Project/client/src`, identifies test directories separately, and imports backend and frontend LCOV reports. Generated files, dependencies and tests are excluded from source analysis. One-off backend CLI scripts are excluded from **coverage**; application controllers, models, pages and the frontend entry point remain in scope. This distinction matters because an untested source file appears as uncovered in SonarQube Cloud even if a test runner's own report lists only imported files.

[Screenshot: SonarQube test repository GitHub Actions run showing backend, frontend, API integration, SonarQube Cloud quality gate and `ci-result` passing.]

### SonarQube Cloud analysis and fixes

The values below are **historical Cloud snapshots from the test repository**. They describe what SonarQube Cloud displayed at different scans, not a current measurement of this Classroom50 repository. A green new-code gate does not mean every finding in overall code has been resolved.

#### Initial project health and code findings

The first Cloud overview showed a passing quality gate alongside **38 overall-code issues**, **43.9% overall coverage** and **1.4% duplication**. Its security snapshot showed rating **E** and four security issues; reliability was **C** with 34 issues; maintainability was **A** with four issues; security hotspots showed **A** and zero hotspots. This prompted a review of the issue list despite the passing gate.

[Screenshot: SonarQube Cloud test-project overview showing the initial quality gate, 38 issues, 43.9% coverage and 1.4% duplication.]

| Cloud finding | Change made in the application |
| --- | --- |
| Three Blocker NoSQL injection issues in registration, booking creation and gig search | Registration uses a scalar email equality filter. Booking creation converts a validated gig ID to a MongoDB `ObjectId`. Gig search uses fixed query fields, escaped literal search text and numeric bounds. These changes prevent request data from becoming MongoDB query operators. |
| Medium reliability findings for unhandled promises across page loaders and navigation | Async effect loaders explicitly start with `void` and handle their own errors; async navigation is awaited where appropriate. Server startup and seed entry points handle rejected promises. |
| Super-linear email-validation regex in the admin controller | Replaced the expression with bounded, deterministic checks so long crafted input does not cause excessive backtracking. |
| Number parsing style and reliability findings in the create-gig form | Uses `Number.parseFloat`, `Number.parseInt` and `Number.isNaN` for the numeric inputs. |

[Screenshot: SonarQube Cloud issue list showing the three original Blocker NoSQL injection findings and the affected files.]

#### Coverage and the quality gate

A later Cloud scan reported **30.26% coverage on 74 new lines**, below the Sonar way gate's **80% new-code coverage** condition. It showed **zero new issues**, but the gate still failed. Backend coverage had been imported while frontend source appeared at 0% because its LCOV report was missing from the scan. The CI scan was changed to generate and import both reports, and tests were added around changed page loaders, navigation and validation. A later GitHub Actions run showed the SonarQube Cloud quality-gate job passing. That passing run does not establish a new overall-coverage percentage by itself.

The Cloud coverage views subsequently showed **57.1%**, then **59% overall coverage**. The 59% view identified large gaps in admin, user and transaction controllers and in several admin, booking and transaction pages. Tests were added for access control, status changes, filtering, deletion and rendered user interactions. Coverage reporting was expanded to include all frontend source files; an unused `AppRoutes.jsx` file with stale imports was removed. The API helper was also fixed to preserve default JSON headers when callers provide other headers. A further Cloud scan is needed to establish the effect of those later changes on the overall figure.

[Screenshot: SonarQube Cloud failed quality gate showing 30.26% new-code coverage against the 80% condition.]

[Screenshot: SonarQube Cloud overall coverage view showing the later 59% figure and the lowest-covered application files.]

#### Dependency risks and the remaining security finding

SonarQube Cloud displayed **89 dependency-risk entries** before the dependency review. The application did not import the direct `node.js@0.0.1-security` npm package, so it was removed; Node.js comes from the runtime, not that package. Dependency locks were updated to patched `handlebars`, `node-forge`, `qs` and `lodash` versions where applicable. Runtime dependency audits were added to CI. The **current Cloud dependency-risk count has not been verified**, so the earlier 89 is a baseline rather than a claim that all risks were cleared.

A later Cloud issue list showed **one open Low security issue**: possible log injection in `Project/server/middleware/errorMiddleware.js`. The fallback logger previously included the request URL and error name, which could contain attacker-controlled newlines. It now logs a generated incident ID and returns that ID in the `X-Incident-Id` response header while keeping the same safe 500 response body. A regression test checks that forged newline text is absent from the log. The screenshot of the open issue predates this fix; a later SonarQube Cloud scan has not been provided to confirm closure.

SonarQube Cloud findings guided the code changes above; the scanner and gate continue to report remaining risks and coverage gaps. The separate test repository provides the Cloud analysis because the Classroom50 repository itself cannot currently connect to that service.

## 17. Logging and monitoring

HustleHub+ records every important action as a **structured JSON log event** and sends it to **Better Stack**, a cloud log platform, as well as to the terminal and local log files. Each line answers *what happened, to whom, from where, and in which request*, so the team can investigate an incident, spot an attack while it is happening, and prove what the system did.

### 17.1 How it works

| Part | File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logger | `Project/server/utils/logger.js` | Winston logger. Writes one JSON object per line, cleans every value, and sends entries to up to three destinations. |
| Request logger | `Project/server/middleware/requestLogger.js` | Gives each request a unique ID (returned in the `X-Request-Id` header) and writes one `http.request` entry with method, route, status code and duration. |
| Event calls | Controllers and middleware | `logEvent(level, "area.action.result", req, details)` at each security or business event (table below). |

**Where logs go**

| Destination | When | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Better Stack** (cloud) | When `BETTER_STACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` and `BETTER_STACK_INGESTING_HOST` are set | Central, searchable storage that survives restarts and containers; live tail, filters, dashboards and alerts |
| Terminal (stdout) | Always | Local development, `docker logs`, GitHub Actions output |
| `Project/server/logs/app.log` | Unless `LOG_TO_FILE=false` | Every entry, rotated at 5 MB (5 files kept) |
| `Project/server/logs/security.log` | Unless `LOG_TO_FILE=false` | `warn` and `error` entries only: a quick list of suspicious activity |

Log files are git-ignored. During automated tests the logger is silent, unless `LOG_LEVEL` is set.

**Every entry contains** `timestamp`, `level`, `event`, `category` (the part before the first dot), `service` (`hustlehub-api`), `environment`, the `requestId`, the client `ip`, and, for signed-in users, `userId` and `userRole`, plus the event's own details. Because all events from one request share a `requestId`, a booking can be followed from the HTTP request to the booking and the transaction it created.

Example (one line in the log, formatted here for reading):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-11-08T13:18:02.658Z",
  "level": "warn",
  "event": "auth.login.failed",
  "category": "auth",
  "reason": "wrong_password",
  "email": "c***@hustlehub.test",
  "accountKey": "a0e5f9a06b02aac0",
  "failedCount": 1,
  "ip": "127.0.0.1",
  "requestId": "b6e090f2-f7b8-46a0-844b-8a9531a3eb75",
  "service": "hustlehub-api",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

### 17.2 What is logged and why

| Area | Events | Level | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Login attempts** | `auth.login.success`, `auth.login.failed` (with `reason`: `unknown_email`, `wrong_password`, `inactive_account`, `no_local_password`, and `failedCount`) | info / warn | Shows who signed in and when. Repeated failures reveal password guessing or credential stuffing. The reason is logged for investigators but never shown to the user. |
| **Account lockout** | `auth.account.locked`, `auth.login.blocked_locked` | error / warn | A brute-force attack against one account. `error` level so it stands out and can trigger an alert. |
| **Registration and logout** | `auth.register.success`, `auth.register.duplicate`, `auth.logout` | info / warn | Account creation history; repeated duplicate attempts can indicate email enumeration. |
| **Tokens** | `auth.token.invalid` (expired, forged or malformed), `auth.token.revoked`, `auth.token.account_unavailable` | warn | Forged or reused tokens are a sign of session hijacking. |
| **Access control** | `access.denied.role`, `access.denied.booking`, `access.denied.transaction` | warn | A user trying to reach another role's routes or someone else's data, which is the main sign of privilege-escalation or IDOR probing. |
| **Bookings** | `booking.created`, `booking.create.rejected`, `booking.status.changed` (from/to), `booking.status.rejected` | info / warn | An audit trail of every booking and status change, for disputes and fraud checks. |
| **Transactions** | `transaction.created` (amount, fee, freelancer amount, invoice), `transaction.status.changed`, `transaction.payout.recorded`, `transaction.payout.rejected`, `transaction.create.failed` | info / warn / error | A financial audit trail: every amount the platform records or pays out can be traced to a request and a user. |
| **Attacks blocked** | `security.rate_limit.auth`, `security.rate_limit.booking`, `security.origin.blocked` | warn | Shows when the rate limits and the CSRF origin check stop real traffic. |
| **Admin actions** | `admin.user.updated` (fields changed, new role, deactivation), `user.account.deactivated` | info / warn | Who changed whose role or disabled whose account. Privileged actions must be accountable. |
| **Errors** | `server.error` (with `incidentId`, route and error class), `server.unhandled_rejection`, `server.uncaught_exception` | error | Unexpected failures. The `incidentId` is also returned to the user in the `X-Incident-Id` header, so a user's report can be matched to the exact log line. |
| **Server lifecycle** | `server.started`, `server.stopping`, `server.start_failed` | info / error | Shows restarts, crashes and deployments. |
| **Every request** | `http.request` (method, route, status, duration) | info, or warn for 4xx and error for 5xx | Traffic, error rates and slow endpoints. |

### 17.3 Keeping the logs safe

Logs are only useful if they can be trusted and do not become a data leak themselves.

- **No secrets:** any field whose name looks like a password, token, secret, cookie, session or authorization header is replaced with `[redacted]`. Passwords and JWTs are never passed to the logger at all.
- **No full email addresses:** emails are masked (`c***@hustlehub.test`) and paired with a short SHA-256 `accountKey`, so repeated attempts on one account can be linked without storing the address.
- **No log injection:** every entry is one JSON object, control characters such as `\r\n` are removed, and strings are capped at 200 characters, so attacker input cannot forge extra log lines. This matches the log-injection fix made after the SonarQube review (section 16).
- **No raw URLs:** the route is logged as a cleaned label (for example `/api/bookings/:param/status`); IDs, query strings and other user-typed text are dropped.
- **Errors are not exposed:** the error message and stack stay on the server. The client only receives the generic message and the incident ID.

### 17.4 Setting up Better Stack (cloud logging)

1. Create a free account at [betterstack.com](https://betterstack.com), go to **Sources** and click **Connect source**.
2. Name it `HustleHub API`, choose **Node.js** as the platform, and create the source.
3. Open the source and click **Configure**. Copy the **Source token** and the **Ingesting host** into `Project/.env`:

   ```env
   BETTER_STACK_SOURCE_TOKEN=your-source-token
   BETTER_STACK_INGESTING_HOST=s123456.eu-nbg-2.betterstackdata.com
   ```

4. Restart the API. The `server.started` event shows `"cloudLogging":"better-stack"` and appears in Better Stack's **Live tail** within a few seconds ([Better Stack Winston guide](https://betterstack.com/docs/logs/javascript/winston/)).

Useful searches in Better Stack: `event:auth.login.failed`, `level:error`, `category:transaction`, `event:auth.account.locked`, or a `requestId` to see everything from one request. The token is a secret: it lives only in `.env` (or the Docker environment / a GitHub Actions secret) and is never committed. Without these two values the app still logs to the terminal and local files.

### 17.5 Logging evidence

**Better Stack Live tail:** HustleHub API events arriving in the cloud (`http.request`, `auth.login.success`, `booking.created`, `transaction.created`).

## 18. Additional security features

Parts 1 and 2 already cover the minimum controls: HTTPS, bcrypt, JWT in an HttpOnly cookie, RBAC, validation, rate limiting, Helmet/CSP and the CSRF origin check. Part 3 adds two security features beyond those minimums. Both are fully tested, logged, and need no frontend changes, because the React app already shows the API's message and already calls the logout endpoint.

### 18.1 Feature 1: Per-account lockout after repeated failed logins

**The gap it closes.** The Part 2 rate limiter counts requests **per IP address**. An attacker spreading guesses across many IP addresses (a botnet or rotating proxies) could still try unlimited passwords against **one** account.

**How it works** (`services/accountLockout.js`, `models/LoginAttempt.js`, `controllers/authController.js`):

1. Every failed sign-in for an email address is counted in the `loginattempts` collection. The address is stored only as a SHA-256 hash.
2. **5 failures within 15 minutes lock that account for 15 minutes.** The fifth failure, and every attempt during the lock, returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header and the message *"Too many failed sign-in attempts. This account is temporarily locked. Try again later."*
3. While locked, **even the correct password is refused** and no session cookie is issued. The password is not even checked, which also saves CPU.
4. A successful sign-in resets the counter. Locks expire on their own, and a MongoDB TTL index deletes old records.
5. **No account enumeration:** unknown email addresses are counted and locked the same way, so an attacker cannot use the lockout to discover which emails are registered. Before the lock, every failure still returns the same generic *"Invalid email or password."*
6. Every failure is logged as `auth.login.failed` with its reason and count, and the lock itself as `auth.account.locked` (level `error`).

The limits can be changed in `.env` (`LOGIN_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS`, `LOGIN_ATTEMPT_WINDOW_MINUTES`, `LOGIN_LOCKOUT_MINUTES`). The trade-off is that someone who knows a user's email could lock them out for 15 minutes. The short, automatic unlock keeps that impact small, and the IP rate limiter still limits how fast one attacker can do it.

| | Before (Part 2) | After (Part 3) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 attacker, 1 IP | Blocked after 30 requests / 15 min | Account locked after 5 wrong passwords |
| Many IPs, 1 account | Unlimited guesses | Account locked after 5 wrong passwords |
| Correct password during an attack | Accepted | Refused until the lock expires |

### 18.2 Feature 2: Server-side session revocation

**The gap it closes.** A JWT is valid until it expires (up to 7 days with the current settings). Before this change, *logging out only deleted the cookie in the browser*. A token that had been copied, for example through a shared computer, malware or a leaked request log, kept working for days. Likewise, a user who was deactivated or had their role changed kept their existing session.

**How it works** (`models/User.js`, `controllers/authController.js`, `middleware/authMiddleware.js`):

1. Every user has a `tokenVersion` number. Each JWT records the version it was issued with (`tv`).
2. On every protected request, `protect` compares the token's version with the user's current version. If they differ, the request is rejected with `401` *"Session has ended. Please log in again."* and an `auth.token.revoked` event is logged.
3. The version is increased when:
   - the user **logs out**, so every token issued before the logout stops working at once, on every device;
   - an admin **changes the user's role** or **deactivates** the account;
   - a user **deletes (deactivates)** their own account, or an admin removes it.
4. Editing other profile details does not log anyone out. Tokens issued before this feature (with no version) count as version 0, so existing sessions keep working until the next logout.

### 18.3 Related hardening by the team

During the SonarQube review (section 16), the team also fixed three NoSQL-injection findings: scalar `$eq` email filters, validated `ObjectId` conversion for bookings, and escaped literal gig search. The login lookup added in this part uses the same `$eq` filter.

### 18.4 How the features are tested

| Test | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `test/account-lockout.test.js` (9 tests) | Locks on the 5th failure with `Retry-After`; email case and spaces cannot bypass it; the correct password is refused while locked; success resets the counter; locks and windows expire; only a hash is stored; unknown emails lock identically. |
| `test/session-revocation.test.js` (9 tests) | Login puts the version in the JWT; logout revokes a copied token; an invalid logout revokes nothing; revoked tokens fail on role-protected routes; role changes and deactivation revoke; ordinary profile edits do not. |
| `test/logging.test.js` (14 tests) | Request IDs and route labels; login, booking, transaction, access-denied, invalid-token, blocked-origin, rate-limit and error events; secrets redacted, emails masked, no log injection, no raw URLs. |
| Postman, main collection, folder 7 | A token copied before logout works, logout succeeds, and the same token is then rejected with `401` *Session has ended*. |
| Postman, `HustleHub Part 3 - Account Lockout Demo` (`npm run test:lockout`) | Four `401`s, a `429` lock with `Retry-After`, the correct password refused while locked, an unknown email locked the same way, and another account unaffected. |

### 18.5 Security feature evidence
